                        This web application is very simple to use. It was designed to display all the shops around NÃ¸rrebro. 
                        User that has the user role have the privilege of creating/registering new shops. Ideally, the shop owners have this kind of role.
                        And user who has admin role has been granted for all the privileges.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You can login as:
                        <br>
                        -username: "user" password: "test"
                        <br>
                        -username: "admin" password: "test"
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        NOTE: As of now, we only have two shops that has right google shop id: VINTRO and Temple Bar. 
                        When you click the  name of the shop, it will appear a pop-up that displays the information such as the shop's name, category, address, website that links to their 
                        web page, opening hours and contact details. When you have tried to add a new shop as a user role, it will be added to the list and to the database respectively.

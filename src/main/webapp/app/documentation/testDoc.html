          <h4><b><i>Unit Test Testing - Facade</i></b></h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We are using an in-memory Derby mock database for the JUnit tests.
                    There are only two facade test so far, the reasoning for this is simple, we fetch data directly from google map API.
                    The information is not stored in the DB in the current version of the app,
                    the resulting JSoN is formatted and displayed directly on the client side using AngularJS.
                    So only two simple test were written to check whether the facade methods are working as they should.
                    The createShopTest adds some users and asserts if they are persisted.

                <h4><b><i>REST-ASSURED TEST</i></b></h4>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    We have implemented REST_Assured framework to test the rest services in our project.
                    It was already setup from the seed wherein it initially tests the authentication for the users. 
                    We have added some test cases wherein it will validate the response that we get once we have created a new shop and
                    get all the shops in a given path from the use of ShopRest. From there, we are expecting 
                    a status code of 200. We also added some tests for the error handling by checking the status code
                    whenever an invalid path was given wherein we get an error code of 404 which means the requested resource was not found. 
                </p>

                        <h4><b><i>Manual Testing with Postman</i></b></h4>
                        <br>
                        To manually test our api we are using postman with a given path.
                        For example, <i>http://localhost:8080/seedMaven/api/shop/all</i> which returns
                        all the shops as json objects and <i>http://localhost:8080/seedMaven/api/shop</i>
                        which could take a new shop from json that corresponds to the Shop entity class 
                        and persist into the database.

    <div class="panel-heading">DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT</div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <p> 
            We have chosen the first choice of having our own project for this CA and a starting point for our semester project.
            We have taken the opportunity to work on a real life project.
            <br><br>
            As part of the community in Nørrebro, Vintro has created a map of local business stores and call it, "Nørrebro On-the-ground". 
            It has started as a business community in Nørrebro with over 300 shops and printed 25,000 cards that are distributed in the east and west, 
            4 newspapers printed this "map" ...and since then, "app" was sought by many, but have never been developed.
            <br><br>
            We aim to develop a web application that will be very useful in line with this idea and make use of what we have learned from this semester and
            nurture our skills while encountering a bunch of error problems. :)
            
        </p>

                <div class="cointainer">
                    <p>Since we are not able to make google API requests directly from the client we have decided 
                        to make the request from the client to our server, from over server to google, then send the result back
                        to the client. It is not the most optimal way of doing it, because we load more traffic onto our server
                        and there is even more steps the information have to travel through to get to the end user, which also
                        makes the application seeming slow.</p>

                <p>
                    We have implemented the use of packages in our program to encapsulate different responsibilities on which parts of the program.
                    It can visibly explain what each does which is extremely important to understand the structure of the program.

                <p>
                    This diagram illustrates different relationships between the entities in our program. For example, different shops may have the same opening hours, therefore,
                    it has one-to-many relationship; Picture and Shop has many-to-one since a shop can have a lot of pictures, and so on.

          <h4><b><i>Unit Test Testing - Facade</i></b></h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We are using an in-memory Derby mock database for the JUnit tests.
                    There are only two facade test so far, the reasoning for this is simple, we fetch data directly from google map API.
                    The information is not stored in the DB in the current version of the app,
                    the resulting JSoN is formatted and displayed directly on the client side using AngularJS.
                    So only two simple test were written to check whether the facade methods are working as they should.
                    The createShopTest adds some users and asserts if they are persisted.	
                </p>

                <h4><b><i>REST-ASSURED TEST</i></b></h4>
                <br>
                <p> 
                    We have implemented REST_Assured framework to test the rest services in our project.
                    It was already setup from the seed wherein it initially tests the authentication for the users. 
                    We have added some test cases wherein it will validate the response that we get once we have created a new shop and
                    get all the shops in a given path from the use of ShopRest. From there, we are expecting 
                    a status code of 200. We also added some tests for the error handling by checking the status code
                    whenever an invalid path was given wherein we get an error code of 404 which means the requested resource was not found. 
                </p>

                        <h4><b><i>Manual Testing with Postman</i></b></h4>
                        <br>
                        To manually test our api we are using postman with a given path.
                        For example, <i>http://localhost:8080/seedMaven/api/shop/all</i> which returns
                        all the shops as json objects and <i>http://localhost:8080/seedMaven/api/shop</i>
                        which could take a new shop from json that corresponds to the Shop entity class 
                        and persist into the database.

                        This web application is very simple to use. It was designed to display all the shops around Nørrebro. 
                        User that has the user role have the privilege of creating/registering new shops. Ideally, the shop owners have this kind of role.
                        And user who has admin role has been granted for all the privileges.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        You can login as:
                        <br>
                        -username: "user" password: "test"
                        <br>
                        -username: "admin" password: "test"
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        
                        NOTE: As of now, we only have two shops that has right google shop id: VINTRO and Temple Bar. 
                        When you click the  name of the shop, it will appear a pop-up that displays the information such as the shop's name, category, address, website that links to their 
                        web page, opening hours and contact details. When you have tried to add a new shop as a user role, it will be added to the list and to the database respectively.

                    We all have been here everyday and worked on different parts of the
                    project. We think that each member should have the full study points.

                <h4><b><i>Bonus points?</i></b></h4>
                    <p>We have helped other groups regarding usage of multipple persistence units,
                        groups from the A class on how to setup and use derby in-memory database, group
                        from A class, with html regarding relative path on files to include. We have
                        spend some time helping other groups, and would suggest to be rewarded for that.
                        It might not be documented on the Q&A site, but feel free to ask for facebook chat log
                        and review pages of instructions written to other groups! ;)</p>

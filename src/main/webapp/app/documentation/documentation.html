    <div class="panel-body">
        <p> 
            We have chosen the first choice of having our own project for this CA and a starting point for our semester project.
            We have taken the opportunity to work on a real life project.
            <br><br>
            As part of the community in Nørrebro, Vintro has created a map of local business stores and call it, "Nørrebro On-the-ground". 
            It has started as a business community in Nørrebro with over 300 shops and printed 25,000 cards that are distributed in the east and west, 
            4 newspapers printed this "map" ...and since then, "app" was sought by many, but have never been developed.
            <br><br>
            We aim to develop a web application that will be very useful in line with this idea and make use of what we have learned from this semester and
            nurture our skills while encountering a bunch of error problems. :)

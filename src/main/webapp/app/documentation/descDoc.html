                <div class="cointainer">
                    <p>Since we are not able to make google API requests directly from the client we have decided 
                        to make the request from the client to our server, from over server to google, then send the result back
                        to the client. It is not the most optimal way of doing it, because we load more traffic onto our server
                        and there is even more steps the information have to travel through to get to the end user, which also
                        makes the application seeming slow.</p>

                    We have implemented the use of packages in our program to encapsulate different responsibilities on which parts of the program.
                    It can visibly explain what each does which is extremely important to understand the structure of the program.

                <p>
                    This diagram illustrates different relationships between the entities in our program. For example, different shops may have the same opening hours, therefore,
                    it has one-to-many relationship; Picture and Shop has many-to-one since a shop can have a lot of pictures, and so on.
